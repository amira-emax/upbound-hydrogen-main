// NOTE: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/discountNodes
// Looks up active discounts so eligible ones can be offered as pickable
// options in the cart. No manually-curated/duplicated list — this reads
// real discounts live from Shopify.
//
// IMPORTANT: `query: $query` only filters by things Shopify's discount
// search actually indexes (status, title, dates, etc.) — `customer_ids:` is
// NOT a supported search term here and is silently ignored rather than
// erroring, so it must never be relied on to scope results to one customer.
// customerSelection is fetched per discount instead, and getCustomerVouchers
// filters by it in code — see there for why.
